Currently pursuing a B.S. in Web Design and Engineering with an Innovation, Design Thinking, and Entrepreneurial Mindset minor at Santa Clara University. Having spent my entire life in California, I grew up with an immense appreciation for the beauty and simplicity of nature. I love to tinker, design, and create, but when I’m not working away at my desk, you’ll likely find me at the driving range or exploring the mountains with my hammock and camera.
